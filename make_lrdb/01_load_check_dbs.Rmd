This script is just to look at the databases I might use to build my lrdb.

# Conversion tables

```{r hgnc_conv, message = FALSE}

# 21.09.2021

table(duplicated(hgnc_conv$hgnc_id))
# no duplicates in the HGNC ids

# CCDB has ensembl IDs and also basically contains mgi_conv for
# the respective genes

# contains subunits, so will be a bit more difficult to incorporate
# contains annotation
# will be useful to add information but not useful to start the lrdb

# mjdb already has the ensembl ids in the order I want but no slots for sources
# because the ensembl IDs are added in the same rows as the interactions,
# they are often duplicated

# I think this is a good basis to start building the dlrb
